From our Observation we clearly see that Dtree is most acurate, then NBBC and NBMC.

Our review of the comparision between NBC and DTC :
we say DTC is better when the training data contains all posiblities ( i.e when the data set is quite big) also on our experementation as you can see above DT have taken more time then NB in which we speculate it as DT picks the best features from the data and this might be the cause for the slower processing ( assuming coding varitions wont matter)
But for smaller data set NB's are quite amazing clasifiers as they dont need to have all posible combinations to reside in the set before hand. 
And NBMC is anytime better then NBBC
